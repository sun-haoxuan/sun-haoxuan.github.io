Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am now an assistant professor at the School of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology. Before that, I obtained the Ph.D. in data science at the [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/), Peking University, supervised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com/), and B.S. in statistics at the [School of Mathematics Science](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/puremath_en/), Peking University.

Currently, my research interests focus on high-dimensional statistics, data assimilation, and its application in geoscience. My past works also focus on environmental statistics and epidemic models. Meanwhile, I also dream of applying statistical methods to *astronomical studies*!

Besides, I was also a part-time barista at [Café Obtus](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CsXiT3ZWsTkdJ12gDyrQrw) in 2023 and 2024.

<!-- I am in the **2024-2025 academic job market** and would be happy to discuss any opportunities. -->
Please kindly find my latest [CV](https://sun-haoxuan.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vita_Jul_2025.pdf) here and feel free to contact me!
